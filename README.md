# T-Rex Brain : neural-net and genetic algorithm

Recoding the T-Rex game from Chrome browser, then add an AI based on neural networks and genetic algorithms \o/

![alt the game](https://mayank4net.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/c6.png)

# Proccess

* Recode the original game, with some modifications
* Apply a parallel neural network and a genetic algorithm to improve it
* Create a user interface to see how the AI rises.

# Libraries

| Library | Objective |
| --- | --- |
| P5.js | Code the game |
| Synaptic.js | Create the neural net |
| JQuery | For the UI |

# Results

Working ! After 40 generations (more or less), the T-Rex learns to jump over cactuses !

# Documentation

A report is available in the repository (french), or via [this link](https://github.com/corbienassisdev/T-Rex-Brain/blob/master/gesp/Rapport%20-%20PII.pdf).
