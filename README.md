# T-Rex Brain : neural-net and genetic algorithm

Recoding the T-Rex game from Chrome browser, then add an AI based on neural networks and genetic algorithms \o/

The project is now hosted on github pages [here](https://corbienassisdev.github.io/TRex-Brain/p5/TREXBRAIN_V08/) !

# Instructions

Click [here](https://corbienassisdev.github.io/TRex-Brain/p5/TREXBRAIN_V08/) to access the site, and just look at the dinosaurs trying to learn! You can display the user interface by pressing the I key, or by selecting the checkbox in the top-right corner. This UI displays data about the neural-net and the genetic algorithm on fly!

# Proccess

* Recode the original game, with some modifications
* Apply a parallel neural network and a genetic algorithm to improve it
* Create a user interface to see how the AI rises.

# Libraries

| Library | Objective |
| --- | --- |
| P5.js | Code the game |
| Synaptic.js | Create the neural net |
| JQuery | For the UI |

# Results

Working ! After 40 generations (more or less), the T-Rex learns to jump over cactuses !

# Report

A report is available in the repository (french), or via [this link](https://github.com/corbienassisdev/T-Rex-Brain/blob/master/gesp/Rapport%20-%20PII.pdf).

Also, the original idea of the project is from Ivan Seidel, a brasilian developer
