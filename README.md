# Proccess

* Recode the original game, with some modifications
* Apply a parallel neural network and a genetic algorithm to improve it
* Create a user interface to see how the AI rises.

# Libraries

| Library | Objective |
| --- | --- |
| P5.js | Code the game |
| Synaptic.js | Create the neural net |
| JQuery | For the UI |

# Results

Working ! After 40 generations (more or less), the T-Rex learns to jump over cactuses !

# Documentation

A report is available in the repository (french).
